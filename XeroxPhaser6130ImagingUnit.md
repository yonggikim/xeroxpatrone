# What's this? #

The imaging unit of the Xerox 6130 and 6140 printer also has a page counter built in. The Information is stored in a EEPROM similar to that in the cartridges.

Information about how to read this information out can be found [here](http://xeroxpatrone.googlecode.com/files/6125-6130_ImageUnit_Connector.pdf).

A EEPROM dump is available for the [Phaser 6130](http://xeroxpatrone.googlecode.com/files/6130_ImageUnit_1073pages.bin) as well as for the [Phaser 6140](http://xeroxpatrone.googlecode.com/files/6140_ImageUnit_6258pages%2080perc.bin).
