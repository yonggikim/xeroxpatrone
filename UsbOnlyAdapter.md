# Usb-only adapter #

For all the notebook users, that have no good old serial port at hand, there are good news: the new [programming tool](XeroxpatroneV2.md) supports a usb-only adapter.

It is a [i2c tiny usb](http://www.harbaum.org/till/i2c_tiny_usb/index.shtml). Just build the adapter from there and attach it to the eeprom. Should work out of the box. A driver is available [here](https://xeroxpatrone.googlecode.com/files/i2c-tiny-usb_driver.zip) (also supports x86, x64, and ia64).

Some connector constructions can be found [here](ChipConnectors.md)
