# What is that about? #

You can use 6130 cartridges in your 6140 printer and vice versa. Xerox introduced some color coding and machine coding mechanically to their cartridges. So a little bit of hardware engineering and filing will be involved. Cheap replacement cartridges "made in china" mostly don't have such a coding so they can be used without modification.

Of course a new [EEPROM](EepromList.md) has also to be flashed to match the target printer type.
